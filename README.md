# Cancer Detection App Utilizing VGG-16 Model 

https://cancer-data-app.herokuapp.com/

Cancer is a name given to a collection of related diseases. The main commonality is that some of the body's cells 
begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues.

Over 120 cancer types have been found, each characterized by abnormal cell growth. Nevertheless, many are treatable 
with a high survival rate.

Our project utilzed VGG-16 convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million images 
from the ImageNet database [1]. The network is 16 layers deep and can classify images 
into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, 
the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. The network 
has an image input size of 224-by-224. For more pretrained networks in MATLAB
